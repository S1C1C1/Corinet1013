<h1>Welcome to Cornet 10:13</h1>
<section class="box">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Corinet 10:13, where faith meets practical solutions. In an age where the internet is both a tool and a challenge, we are dedicated to equipping Christian families and church leaders with the knowledge and strategies to safeguard their loved ones from online temptations. Together, we can create a safer digital environment grounded in Christian values. </p>

<p>Our name is derived from 1 Corinthians 10:13 </p>

<blockquote><i>God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. <a href="https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+10/">(ESV)</a> </i></blockquote>

<p>We have this name because God has already provided most of the tools necessary for us to mitigate these temptations. </p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>The first step is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model"> Threat Modeling </a>. In short, Threat Modeling is developing a plan to mitigate risks, in our case the risks created by temptations. Each age group will have a different threat model. <br>The next step is to procure the necessary materials and set them up. It really is that easy. </p>

<h2>For Parents</h2>
<p> The guides for parents are relatively simple, since they only need to affect one family and idealy one or few networks</p>

<h2>For Pastors and Elders</h2>
<p>For Congregation wide programs, Pastors and Elders will have to consider situations ranging from recommendations for parents to adult members of the Congregation undergoing extreme temptations exacerbated by unrestricted internet access</p>
